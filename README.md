# OPTIC2D
This is a project that I want to work on with a community it is a 2d game engine based around PyGame (might change) it will have modular systems built around making game dev in python even easier.

If you want to join in on this project and make this engine even better and easier to use then join this discord server and signup to be a dev
https://discord.gg/meqtDvPS4H (Also please tell me what to improve in this server because im not very good with servers)

The code in this repo is the first phase and I will not be posting anything else until I have something very functional and with at least another developer in the community
